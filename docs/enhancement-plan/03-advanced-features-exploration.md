# Task 3: Advanced Features Exploration

## Objective
Research and evaluate two powerful systems for potential integration: moai-adk and OpenSpec. Determine if and how they should be integrated into the unified-ai-mcp-tool project.

## Status
- [ ] moai-adk documentation review completed
- [ ] OpenSpec documentation review completed
- [ ] Compatibility analysis completed
- [ ] Use case identification completed
- [ ] Proposal created
- [ ] Implementation plan approved (if proceeding)
- [ ] Integration completed (if approved)
- [ ] Testing completed (if approved)

## Required Documentation Review
**You MUST read and understand these resources before proposing any changes:**

### Primary Resources
- [moai-adk](https://github.com/modu-ai/moai-adk) - Explore repository, README, documentation
- [OpenSpec](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec) - Explore repository, README, documentation

### Context
These tools were identified as "molto potenti" (very powerful) and worthy of exploration. Your job is to:
1. Understand what they do
2. Evaluate their power/capabilities
3. Determine integration feasibility
4. Propose integration approach (if beneficial)

## Research Questions to Answer

### For moai-adk
1. **Purpose**: What problem does it solve?
2. **Core Features**: What are its main capabilities?
3. **Architecture**: How is it structured?
4. **Dependencies**: What does it require?
5. **Integration**: How could it integrate with our MCP system?
6. **Use Cases**: What specific problems in our project could it solve?
7. **Alternatives**: Do we already have similar capabilities?

### For OpenSpec
1. **Purpose**: What problem does it solve?
2. **Core Features**: What are its main capabilities?
3. **Architecture**: How is it structured?
4. **Dependencies**: What does it require?
5. **Integration**: How could it integrate with our MCP system?
6. **Use Cases**: What specific problems in our project could it solve?
7. **Alternatives**: Do we already have similar capabilities?

### Compatibility Analysis
1. Are these tools compatible with MCP architecture?
2. Do they conflict with existing tools?
3. What's the learning curve?
4. What's the maintenance burden?
5. Are they actively maintained?
6. What's the community/support situation?

## Instructions for Implementation

### Phase 1: Deep Research
1. Clone and explore both repositories locally
2. Read all documentation thoroughly
3. Run examples if provided
4. Check issues/discussions for insights
5. Review code architecture
6. Identify dependencies and requirements

### Phase 2: Analysis & Evaluation
Create a comprehensive analysis document covering:
1. **Feature Matrix**: Compare capabilities
2. **Architecture Alignment**: How they fit with our system
3. **Value Proposition**: What unique value they provide
4. **Integration Complexity**: Effort required (low/medium/high)
5. **Risk Assessment**: Potential issues or concerns
6. **Recommendation**: Integrate, wait, or skip (with rationale)

### Phase 3: Integration Proposal (if recommended)
**Only if you recommend integration, create a proposal that includes:**
1. Integration approach and architecture
2. Required changes to unified-ai-mcp-tool
3. Configuration requirements
4. Usage examples
5. Documentation plan
6. Testing strategy
7. Phased rollout plan (if complex)

### Phase 4: Update This Task
After completing your research:
1. Check off documentation review items
2. Check off "Compatibility analysis completed"
3. Check off "Use case identification completed"
4. Check off "Proposal created"
5. Link your analysis document here: `[Analysis](file://path/to/analysis.md)`
6. Link your proposal document here (if applicable): `[Proposal](file://path/to/proposal.md)`

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Thorough understanding of both tools documented
- [ ] Clear recommendation with strong rationale
- [ ] If integrating: detailed, actionable implementation plan
- [ ] If not integrating: clear reasons documented for future reference
- [ ] All findings are well-documented for team knowledge

## Notes
- Don't rush this research - thoroughness is more important than speed
- Look for overlap with existing capabilities
- Consider long-term maintenance implications
- Think about how these tools fit into the larger ecosystem
- Document findings even if you recommend against integration
